TestNG :
    is a tool used to perform unit and integration testing.

Data driven testing : when one Test cases executes against multiple set of data, we call it 'data driven testing'.

    + Annotation
        @Test           -   it is a chief annotation of testing and every TC starts with it. By default it follows
                            alphabetical order for execution.
        @BeforeTest
        @AfterTest

        @BeforeClass
        @AfterClass

        = if else statement's use in Java/Selenium

Verification VS validation
    Verification : checking the existence
    Validation   : checking the correctness of the field after existence

Assertions in TestNG ( 2type )

        Hard Assertion :
            - whenever assertion 'fails' in hard assertion - it will stop the execution

        Soft Assertion :
            - it allows us to have multiple verification and validation checkpoints
              if assertions fails in between, still it allows us to execute the code till the last
              and will give the consolidated report
