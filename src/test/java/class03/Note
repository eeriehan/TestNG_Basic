************Test NG**************

1.  @BeforeClass    ->  execute just once before the class starts to execute
    @AfterClass    ->  execute just once after the whole class has executed

2.  Data Provider
    if we have a diverse data set then we can use data provider to feed the test data to our test case

    @dataProvider(name="credentials")
    we declare the data in a form of 2Darray

    if i want to use the data provider in a test case
    @Test (dataProvider ='credentials')
    public void login(){

    }

    in order to use to use data from 2D array i must give in the parameters,
    the parameters are going to be equal to the number of columns, willthe follow a sequence.
    How many times the function @Test is going to execute ???? -> equal to the number of rows we have in our Data provider

    ******** Listeners****

1.  Why do we need listeners?
    because we have no way of performing an action if our test case pass, fails, igores etc

2.  How do we use listners>
    1. Create a class that implements ITestListener
    @Override the functions available to us in ItestListner

    ontestSucces()
    OnTestFailure()

    2. Link in to the class/package through the xml file.
    <Suite>
        <Listeners>
                <Listeners name="what ever class you have implemented ur listeners in"/>
        <Listeners/>
